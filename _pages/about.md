I currently work as a Data Scientist III for the [BIO5 Institute](https://bio5.org/) at the University of Arizona. I work primarily on the [Cyverse](http://www.cyverse.org) project where my role is to expand the knowledge-base and accessibility of drone imagery tools while promoting the principles of open science.
