I currently work as a Data Scientist III for the [BIO5 Institute](https://bio5.org/) at the University of Arizona. I work primarily on the [Cyverse](http://www.cyverse.org) project where my role is to expand the knowledge-base and accessibility of drone imagery tools while promoting the principles of open science. I develop aerial photography and machine learning processing pipelines on high computation cloud resources such [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/about/index.html). 

I have been working in the GIS/Remote Sensing field since 2007 and began focusing on aerial photography collection and analysis in 2011. In this journey I've had the honor of working for multiple National Parks (Yellowstone, Petersburg National Battlefield), the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and a few universities (New Mexico State & Arizona).
