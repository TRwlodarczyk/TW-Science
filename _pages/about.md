I am a PhD student pursuing a degree in [Environmental Science](https://environmentalscience.cales.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona. My research focuses on the identification and study of native plant species that accumulate and tolerate heavy metals. In my PhD program, I am collaborating with researchers from The French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) at the intersection of phytoremediation and green chemistry. I also conduct research within the Center for Environmentally Sustainable Mining at the University of Arizona [(CESM)](https://cesm.arizona.edu/).
